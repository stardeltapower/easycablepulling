## Implementation Guidelines

### For Each Component:
1. **Implementation**
   - Write clean, type-hinted code
   - Follow existing patterns and conventions
   - Use appropriate design patterns

2. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests first (TDD approach)
   - Achieve >90% code coverage
   - Include edge cases and error conditions

3. **Documentation**
   - Update docstrings for all public functions
   - Update README.md with new features
   - Add usage examples to docs/

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Run pre-commit hooks
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Update CHANGELOG.md
   - No commits until component is complete

### Clarified Requirements:

Based on user feedback, the following decisions have been made:

1. **Elevation Data**:
   - The input.dxf file does NOT contain elevation data (confirmed)
   - Elevation support is NOT required for the first version
   - May be added in future versions

2. **Friction Coefficients**:
   - Friction values apply to all sections by default
   - If sections have different friction, user provides a list in section order
   - Standard friction values added to config.py from Cable Pulling reference
   - Support for single cable and trefoil configurations

3. **Multi-Cable Scenarios**:
   - Multi-cable support is ESSENTIAL from the start
   - Support single cable, cables in trefoil, and duct configurations
   - Use IEC standards for jam factor (preferred over IEEE)
   - Cable arrangement affects friction coefficients

4. **Output Preferences**:
   - Start with CSV/JSON output only
   - PDF reports are not required initially
   - Output fields to be determined during implementation

5. **Validation Tolerances**:
   - Tolerances are CONFIGURABLE (not hardcoded)
   - When standard bends can't match within tolerance: highlight/warn
   - Use advisory warnings rather than strict failures

6. **DXF Layer Naming**:
   - Expect only ONE layer in input files
   - One or multiple polylines that form a single route
   - No specific layer name requirements

7. **Development Priority**:
   - Include from start: single cable, trefoil, duct configurations
   - Elevation support NOT required initially
   - Focus on core functionality with multi-cable support

## Development Timeline

- **Weeks 1-2**: Core models and DXF I/O
- **Weeks 3-4**: Geometry processing and fitting
- **Weeks 5-6**: Calculations and analysis pipeline

Total estimated time: 8 weeks for full implementation

## Success Metrics

- All acceptance criteria from SCOPE.md met
- >90% test coverage
- Performance: <5 seconds for typical route analysis
